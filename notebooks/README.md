# Notebooks

Keep exploratory Jupyter notebooks in this folder. Use `.ipynb` files for visualization and interactive analysis.

Do not commit large exported datasets; write final CSVs/figures to `outputs/`.

This folder now includes `technical_indicators.ipynb`, a notebook demonstrating how to load price data, compute SMA/RSI/MACD (using `TA-Lib` or `pandas_ta` fallback), and visualize results with `matplotlib` and optional `plotly`.
See the repository `requirements.txt` for recommended optional dependencies.
